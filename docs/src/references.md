Argos has lead to several publications in peer-reviewed journals.

[PP2022](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611977141.6) details how
Argos is evaluating the second-order reduced derivatives in parallel on the
GPU. All results were generated with [this artifact](https://github.com/exanauts/Argos.jl/tree/master/papers/pp2022).

[PSCC2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779622004679)
uses the augmented Lagrangian algorithm implemented in Argos to solve
static and real-time OPF. All results were generated with [this artifact](https://github.com/exanauts/Argos.jl/tree/master/papers/pscc2022).

[ARXIV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11875) demonstrates the full
capabilities of Argos to solve large-scale OPF on CUDA GPU, both in the
full-space and in the reduced-space.
